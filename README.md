# GroundingDINO-Inference
This project represents a GroundingDINO Inference (zero-shot object detection) procedure. This implementation will help the reader to know the sequence of commands and exemplifying commands for running a quick zero-shot object detection. This is the Google Colab implementation and has some prerequisites for the complete execution of the script.
